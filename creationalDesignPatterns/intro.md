## Design Patterns 
* Solve recurring problems
* Built into frameworks and programming languages
* Proven solutions
* Increased Efficiency
* Future-Proof
* Flexibility
* Robustness

### Risks and Limitations
* Tough Decisions
* Does pattern occur frequency?
* Additional tweaking may be required

## Unified Modeling Languages
* Class Diagram (static)
* Sequence Diagram (dynamic)
* StarUML3

Relationships
* Generalization
* Associations
* Dependency
* Aggregation
* Composition
* Realization
